{"name":"Ardrone2control","tagline":"[ROS - Hydro - Indigo] Trajectory Control for AR.Drone ver 2.0 quadrotor model","body":"### Welcome to the project of AR.Drone quadrotor ver 2.0 trajectory control \r\nRecently, AR.Drone quadrotor model version 2.0 has popularly employed in multiple research projects because of inexpensive price and advanced built-in sensors. Previous works have developed a method to control the AR.Drone quadrotor by sending control signals (command velocities) without modifying the attitude control of the quadrotor. As a result, that method is only applied for visual navigation applications and can not be used for the study of quadrotor trajectory control.\r\n\r\nThis project will introduce a comprehensive work to apply AR.Drone for the study of trajectory control. Researchers can modify the attitude control and state estimation of the quadrotor. The project is developed on Robot Operating System in order to utilize other useful packages for their studies.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTrung Nguyen (tn0432@mun.ca), Oscar De Silva (sendtooscar@gmail.com)\r\nIntelligent Systems Lab, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
